# Advanced Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) Solver

A sophisticated Python implementation for solving complex vehicle routing problems with multiple vehicle types, capacities, and costs. This solver combines recursive optimization algorithms with mathematical programming verification through OR-Tools.

## Features

- **Multiple Vehicle Types**: Vehicles with different capacities, fixed costs, and fuel consumption rates
- **Multi-Commodity Constraints**: Support for multiple goods types (H and K) with separate capacity constraints
- **Required Path Constraints**: Routes must pass through specific nodes (G and H) in an optimal order at the end
- **Comprehensive Cost Model**: Balances fixed vehicle costs and distance-based variable costs
- **OR-Tools Verification**: Mathematical model using Google OR-Tools to verify optimality
- **Solution Quality Analysis**: Detailed metrics on vehicle utilization, distance efficiency, and cost breakdown
- **Extensible Framework**: Modular design allows for easy addition of new constraints and problem variants

## Problem Definition

The solver addresses a specific variant of the Vehicle Routing Problem with these characteristics:

- **Multiple Depots**: A central hub where all vehicles start and end their routes
- **Node Types**: 
  - Hub (node 0)
  - Delivery locations (nodes 1-4, labeled A-D)
  - Required path nodes (nodes 5-6, labeled G-H)
  - Optional extension nodes (nodes 7-8, labeled E-F)
- **Vehicle Fleet**: 5 vehicle types (V, W, X, Y, Z) with different capacities and costs
- **Goods Types**: Two commodity types (H and K) with different demand at each location
- **Cost Structure**: 
  - Fixed cost per vehicle used
  - Variable fuel cost based on distance traveled
- **Path Constraints**: 
  - Every route must start at the hub
  - Every route must end by visiting G, H, and then returning to the hub
  - The order of G and H can be optimized based on which is closer to the last delivery

## Algorithms

The solver uses two primary algorithms:

### 1. Recursive Optimization Algorithm

The main solving approach uses a recursive depth-first search with intelligent pruning:

- Explores all feasible vehicle-to-node assignments
- Considers all possible node subsets for each vehicle
- Optimizes route ordering within each subset
- Applies strategic pruning to reduce the search space
- Prioritizes exploration by vehicle efficiency (capacity-to-cost ratio)

### 2. OR-Tools Mathematical Model

For verification, the problem is formulated as a Mixed Integer Program (MIP):

- Creates binary variables for vehicle selection and node assignment
- Precomputes optimal routes for each vehicle-subset combination
- Enforces capacity constraints, node coverage, and route continuity
- Uses the SCIP solver through Google OR-Tools to find the mathematically optimal solution

## Solution Validation

All solutions are automatically validated to ensure:

- All delivery nodes are visited exactly once
- Vehicle capacity constraints are respected
- Routes start and end at the hub
- Required nodes (G and H) are visited in the correct order
- All cost calculations are accurate

## Solution Quality Analysis

The solver provides detailed metrics on solution quality:

- **Vehicle Utilization**: How efficiently each vehicle's capacity is used
- **Distance Efficiency**: Comparison to theoretical minimum distances
- **Cost Breakdown**: Analysis of fixed vs. variable costs
- **Comparative Analysis**: When using the --verify flag, compares the recursive solution to the OR-Tools mathematical solution

## Customization

To customize the problem instance, edit the following files:

- `models/data.py`: 
  - Modify the distance matrix to change node locations
  - Adjust demands to change delivery requirements
  - Update vehicle_choices to modify the available fleet

- `algorithms/routing.py`: 
  - Modify route calculation logic to implement different routing rules
  - Adjust feasibility checking for additional constraints

- `algorithms/recursive_solver.py`: 
  - Tune the optimization algorithm parameters
  - Modify the pruning strategy to balance speed vs. optimality

## Example Output
