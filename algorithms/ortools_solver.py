    Create and solve a mathematical model of the problem using OR-Tools
    to verify the solution from our recursive algorithm.
    
    This function formulates the vehicle routing problem as a Mixed Integer Program (MIP)
    and uses OR-Tools to solve it. The main difference from the recursive approach is that
    this formulation:
    
    1. Uses a mathematical model with variables, constraints and an objective function
    2. Leverages a commercial-grade solver (SCIP) to find the optimal solution
    3. Provides a different algorithmic approach to verify our recursive solution
